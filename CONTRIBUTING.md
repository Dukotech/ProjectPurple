# Welcome to Project Purple!

_**THIS PAGE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT**_

We'd love for you to contribute to our source code and to make Identity Server 4 Admin UI better than it is today! Here are the guidelines we'd like you to follow.

## Code Style

For code style, use what is most idiomatic in language being worked in. If there is disagreement, then default to the organization wide suggestion:

-   2 character wide indents
-   Indent using spaces
-   Use a style enforcer if possible (e.g. jshint and gofmt)

# Pull Requests

If you report an issue, weâ€™d love to see a pull request attached. Please keep in mind that your commit may end up getting modified. 

-   To get code into the master branch, use a pull request
-   A pull request must go through a code review by a team member different from the submitter of the pull request.
-   A pull request can be merged once there is approval by a team member. Approval should come in a form of a comment on the GitHub pull request.
-   Do not squash commits. It is helpful to see the commit history

### Commit messages

Commit messages should be detailed and be descriptive and follow a format

-   Write commit messages as a sentence
-   Capitalize sentences
-   Make sure one commit does just one thing
-   Use either:
    -   Present tense of the commit does

Examples:

-   Add catching of error in Baz
-   Improve support for the Foo library
-   Fix off by one error in the Bar loop
